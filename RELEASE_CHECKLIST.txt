CRITICAL (Must Fix)
1. Test all figure scripts - Run each .R file in figures/ to ensure they complete without errors
2. Run unit tests - devtools::test() for R package tests
3. Check for missing data files - Ensure all CSV references exist and are accessible
4. Verify package dependencies - Make sure DESCRIPTION has all required packages

HIGH PRIORITY (Should Fix)
5. Update README.md - Add basic installation and usage (DONE)
6. Run devtools::check() - Catch any real package issues
7. Clean up any broken code - Fix actual errors, not warnings

Start with #1 and #2 - test the figures and run the unit tests. If either fails, that's a show-stopper for release.
